# Version Changelog

- **v3 Architecture & Trust Boundaries**: Reframes the wallet around explicit trust boundaries and component separations (UI, wallet engine, crypto core, network adapter, storage). Adds attack-surface annotations, diagrams, and clearer expectations for node trust and on-device key custody.
- **v2 Model & Security Boundaries**: Extends the foundational paper with a full threat model, enumerating adversaries, assets, and out-of-scope items. Tightens assumptions around node trust, on-device storage integrity, and explicit user confirmations before signing.
- **v1 Foundations**: Establishes the initial Kernel Wallet vision and high-level lifecycle for self-custody without committing to implementation details; source text preserved intact for reference.
